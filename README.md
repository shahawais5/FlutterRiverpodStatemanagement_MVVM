# 📱 Flutter App – MVVM Architecture with Riverpod

A modular and scalable Flutter application structured using **MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)** architecture and powered by **Riverpod** for state management. This app demonstrates a clean separation of concerns, dependency injection, and robust navigation handling—all while remaining reactive and testable.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Flutter** – Cross-platform UI framework  
- **Riverpod** – Modern, safe, and compile-time dependency-aware state management  
- **MVVM Architecture** – Clear separation of UI (View), business logic (ViewModel), and data (Model)  
- **REST API Integration** – Secure login and data operations  
- **Material Design** – Consistent and intuitive user interface

## 🧠 Architectural Overview

This project adopts the **MVVM** pattern to ensure:

- A clear division between UI and logic  
- Ease of testing and maintenance  
- Reusability of business logic across multiple views  

Each feature is built using the following pattern:

- **Model**: Represents API response and domain objects  
- **View**: Stateless widgets observing ViewModel providers  
- **ViewModel**: Riverpod `StateNotifier` or `Notifier` exposing reactive state and business logic  

---

## 🌿 Why Riverpod?

Riverpod is chosen for its:

- Compile-time safety and refactoring support  
- Provider lifecycle awareness  
- Fine-grained control over state updates  
- Compatibility with async APIs (via `AsyncNotifier`, `FutureProvider`, etc.)  
- Simplified testing through pure Dart constructs  

### 🔄 State Management Flow

1. **User Interaction** → Triggers ViewModel method  
2. **ViewModel** updates the state via a `Notifier` or `AsyncNotifier`  
3. **Riverpod Provider** exposes the state to the UI  
4. **View** rebuilds automatically with the new state

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.x)  
- Dart SDK  
- Device or emulator  

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
cd yourproject
flutter pub get
flutter run
````

## 🔐 Login Example (Riverpod + MVVM)

```dart
// ViewModel
final loginViewModelProvider = StateNotifierProvider<LoginViewModel, AsyncValue<User>>(
  (ref) => LoginViewModel(ref.read),
);

// View
Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, child) {
    final loginState = ref.watch(loginViewModelProvider);
    return loginState.when(
      data: (user) => Text("Welcome ${user.name}"),
      loading: () => CircularProgressIndicator(),
      error: (e, _) => Text("Login failed: $e"),
    );
  },
);
```
