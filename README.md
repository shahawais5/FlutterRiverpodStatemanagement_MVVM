Flutter App – MVVM Architecture with Riverpod
A modular and scalable Flutter application structured using MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel) architecture and powered by Riverpod for state management. This app demonstrates a clean separation of concerns, dependency injection, and robust navigation handling—all while remaining reactive and testable.

🔧 Tech Stack
Flutter – Cross-platform UI framework

Riverpod – Modern, safe, and compile-time dependency-aware state management

MVVM Architecture – Clear separation of UI (View), business logic (ViewModel), and data (Model)

REST API Integration – Secure login and data operations

Material Design – Consistent and intuitive user interface

🧠 Architectural Overview
This project adopts the MVVM pattern to ensure:

A clear division between UI and logic

Ease of testing and maintenance

Reusability of business logic across multiple views

Each feature is built using the following pattern:

Model: Represents API response and domain objects

View: Stateless widgets observing ViewModel providers

ViewModel: Riverpod StateNotifier or Notifier exposing reactive state and business logic

🌿 Why Riverpod?
Riverpod is chosen for its:

Compile-time safety and refactoring support
Provider lifecycle awareness
Fine-grained control over state updates
Compatibility with async APIs (via AsyncNotifier, FutureProvider, etc.)
Simplified testing through pure Dart constructs

🔄 State Management Flow
User Interaction → Triggers ViewModel method
ViewModel updates the state via a Notifier or AsyncNotifier
Riverpod Provider exposes the state to the UI
View rebuilds automatically with the new state

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Flutter SDK (3.x)
Dart SDK
Device or emulator

Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
flutter pub get
flutter run
🔐 Login Example (Riverpod + MVVM)

// ViewModel
final loginViewModelProvider = StateNotifierProvider<LoginViewModel, AsyncValue<User>>(
(ref) => LoginViewModel(ref.read),
);

// View
Consumer(
builder: (context, ref, child) {
final loginState = ref.watch(loginViewModelProvider);
return loginState.when(
data: (user) => Text("Welcome ${user.name}"),
loading: () => CircularProgressIndicator(),
error: (e, _) => Text("Login failed: $e"),
);
},
);

📦 Packages Used
flutter_riverpod – State management

http – REST API calls

go_router or custom Navigator – Routing

equatable – Value equality for models

flutter_hooks (optional) – Reactive UI logic

✅ Best Practices Followed
✅ Single Responsibility Principle

✅ Riverpod for scalable state management

✅ Centralized routing

✅ ViewModel-driven navigation via service abstraction

✅ Error handling and loading states via AsyncValue
